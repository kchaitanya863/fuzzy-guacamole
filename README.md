# fuzzy-guacamole

## Description
This project is a simple time saving tool for corporate employees. 
Helps them keep their computer running by hitting the `control` key every minute.

Adjust the time according to your need.

From personal experience, I have found that 60 seconds is a good number to hit the `control` key. Also, the program never felt interupting my work as it is very fast in execution.

## Usage
To use this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install keyboard
chmod +x dont_sleep.py
```

Then, you can run the program by typing:

```bash
python3 dont_sleep.py
```

OR

```bash
./dont_sleep.py
```

## Can't install dependencies?
